### Layers

<b> What are Layers? </b>
Layers are collections of geographic data, referencing a data source. If the data is spatial, the properties and attributes specify how the layer draws together the map, scene, or layout. The data is represented with points, lines, polygons or surfaces. Multiple layers make up a Geographic Information System that contains groups of these points, lines or polygons to represent a particular type of real-world entitiy such as streets, rivers, elevations, people etc.

Layers typically are made of up vector (feature) or raster data. Rasster layers reference rasters or images as their data source, and can be visualised as a single raster dataset or a mosaic layer that manages multiple large collections of the raster data.
