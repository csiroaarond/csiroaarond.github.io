### Projections

<b> What are Projections? </b>
The means in which the coordinate system and data is displayed onto a flat surface. Also referred to as Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS), mathematical calculations are performed to convert the curved surface of the Earth onto a 2d surface. As there is no perfect way to convert the curvature of the Earth's surface into a a flat image without distortion, various projection techniques exist with their own advantages and disadvantages. Some preserve distance, whereas some prefer shape, area or direction. These factors are what decide the type of projection is used. There are over 4000 map coordinate projection systems, and if none of those fit the data, a custom one can be created.
